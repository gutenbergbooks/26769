<h2>OPENING OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE.</h2>

<p>Another Show! A splendid Imperial Show! Magnificent
weather! Real <span class="sc">Queen's</span> weather, and consequently a big success.
The grandeur, the solidarity of the British Empire&mdash;[&amp;c., &amp;c.
<span style="line-height: 50%">*<sub>*</sub>*</span> <i>Editor regrets that for lack of space he is compelled to omit the
remainder of this remarkably fine panegyric. He suggests to Author
that it would come out well in pamphlet form, price one shilling, or it
might be given away with a pound of Indian tea.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span>] Obedient to
the call of duty I was myself present as one of the 'umblest of the
distinguished guests assembled to welcome Her Imperial <span class="sc">Majesty</span> on
this auspicious occasion. It was my good fortune to be immediately
in front of a charming Young Lady and her delightful Grandmother.
The latter was a trifle deaf, and her Granddaughter being a
wonderfully well-informed young lady, I had quite an enjoyable
time of it; as had also my neighbours, though I regret to say that
some of them after the first three-quarters of an hour seemed
rather to resent the gratuitous information given with astonishing
volubility by the amiable Young Lady to her confiding relative.
For example, up came his Grace the Archbishop of <span class="sc">Canterbury</span>.
"That's the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>," our well-informed Young Lady
told her Grandmother. Much cheering greets Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury</span>.
"That's General <span class="sc">Roberts</span>," said the Young Lady, adding, as if
rather doubting her own accuracy, "though why he wears a naval
uniform I am unable to say." It didn't matter; her Grandmother
was equally pleased. "Which is Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>?" asked the Old
Lady. The Young Lady used her opera-glass. "I don't see
him," she returned slowly. "Of course he can't be in a turban. I
know he has no whiskers or moustache&mdash;ah! there he is!&mdash;there,
talking to Sir <span class="sc">Edward Leighton</span>!" She hadn't got even the
Christian names correct. I looked in the direction she had
indicated and saw Sir <span class="sc">William Harcourt</span> in close proximity to
Sir <span class="sc">Richard Temple</span>. But why should I turn and dispel the
harmless illusion? Was it for me to bring discord into a family,
and cause the Granddaughter to be cut out of the Grandmother's
will? Never! So, "from information received,"
the Old Lady went on implicitly believing in her informant, and
treasuring up the particulars for the benefit of her other Grandchildren.
"Lord <span class="sc">Roberts</span> is somewhere here," observed the Young
Lady, sweeping the horizon (so to speak, with apologies to "the
horizon") with her <i>lorgnette</i>. "Oh, I should like to see <i>him</i>!"
exclaimed the Old Lady, enthusiastically. "Where is he?" "Oh,
I think&mdash;" replied the Granddaughter, hesitatingly, "I rather&mdash;think&mdash;I've
only seen him once&mdash;but&mdash;oh yes," she added, with
wonderful confidence on finding she was commanding an interested
audience of simple neighbours&mdash;"Oh yes&mdash;there&mdash;in a General's
uniform,&mdash;he has just come in&mdash;and he is looking for his place,"&mdash;and,
following guidance, I, too, craned forward, and was rewarded
by catching a glimpse of Mr. <span class="sc">Frederick Gordon</span>, Chairman of the
Grand Hotels Co., Limited, who was good enough to salute me with
that air of conscious power which becomes part and parcel of a man
who has the command of countless battalions in waiting. Encouraged
by this incident (for I had not rounded on her and said,
"that is <i>not</i> Lord <span class="sc">Roberts</span>") the Young Lady urged on her mistaken
career more wildly than ever. She pointed out the wrong
Princess <span class="sc">May</span>, the Duke of <span class="sc">Fife</span> became H.R.H. the Duke of
<span class="sc">York</span>,
the <span class="sc">Tecks</span> were the <span class="sc">Mecklenburg-Strelitzes</span>, the
Gentlemen-at-Arms
were dismounted Chelsea Pensioners in Court dress; the
Chinese ladies were Japanese (for they couldn't get even these
correct,&mdash;and of course these Orientals are most correct), and finally,
looking up to the gallery where the Orchestra was, she crowned the
edifice by loudly announcing that Sir <span class="sc">Arthur Sullivan</span> was Sir
<span class="sc">Arthur Balfour</span>, and added that he was only performing his
official duty as Leader of the House of Commons. "Then," asked
the simple Old Lady, "are the musicians all obliged to be Members
of Parliament?" Her Granddaughter was equal to the occasion,
and answered unhesitatingly, "Yes, dear, <i>all</i>."</p>

<h4>"A Legal Conveyance."</h4></div>

<hr />

<p>After this, what was the show! Everybody was somebody else.
Only the <span class="sc">Queen</span> and the <span class="sc">Prince</span> were beyond the power of error.
She found them out at once. She was enthusiastic about the
distinctness of the <span class="sc">Prince</span>'s voice in reading the Address, and she
bent forward so as not to lose a syllable of the <span class="sc">Queen</span>'s gracious
reply. She explained everything wrong. A few ladies looked at
her, mutely beseeching some respite for their ears; would she only
give herself ten minutes' rest? No&mdash;it was a great chance for the
well-informed young woman, and she made the most of it. Even
the heat didn't affect her. Processions might come, and processions
might go, but like the babbling brook, she could and would "go
on for ever." I have forgotten to add that she also knew how everyone
arrived, and her Grandmother was much interested at hearing
how Her Majesty's Judges all came in an omnibus, driven and
conducted by eminent judicial functionaries.</p>

<p>A grand show, "Abely worked by our Secretary," says Sir
Early-Springs-and-<span class="sc">Somers
Vine</span>, C.M.G., Assistant Secretary, and to both of
them great praise is due. Now, then, to adapt the title of Lord

<h4>"Le Sabre de mon p&egrave;re!"</h4></div>

<p>In the <i>Song of the Sword and Other Verses</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Henley</span>
incidentally asks, "What have I done for you, England, my
England?" Since the question is put so pointedly, my Baronite,
who has been looking through the
little volume of verse, is bound to
reply that, what Mr. <span class="sc">Henley</span> has
done for England is to make it as
ridiculous as is possible to a man
with a limited audience. Mr.
<span class="sc">Henley</span> has a pretty gift of versification,
but it is spoiled by a
wearisome proneness to smartness,
and an assumption of personal superiority
that occasionally reaches
the heights of the ludicrous. If
<span class="sc">'Arry</span> had been at the University,
and had bent what he calls his
mind upon verse-making, some of
the truculent rhyme in this book is
the sort of stuff he would have
turned out. It seems at first hearing
a far cry from '<span class="sc">Arry</span> to <span class="sc">Henley</span>.
But the dispassionate reader,
turning over these sulphurous
leaves, will perceive deeply-rooted
similarity in that narrowness of
view, and that undisturbed consciousness
that it alone is right,
which distinguish the reflections, and are found in the observations,
of '<span class="sc">Arry</span> when he views society from his lower standpoint.</p>

<p>Messrs. <span class="sc">Hutchinson</span> &amp; Co. have published a <i>Book of Wise
Sayings</i>, by <span class="sc">W. A. Clouston</span>. Not that <span class="sc">W. A. Clouston</span> said
them
all, or any of them, but he selected them. One fault has the Baron to
find with the selecting collector, and that is that his references are
incomplete. He affixes the name of the author to every wise
saying, but as he does not give chapter and verse, it is impossible
for the ordinary unlearned reader to ascertain when and where the
wise saying was uttered. Perhaps this omission is wise on the part
of Mr. <span class="sc">Clouston</span>. However, here is a happy example for the time
present:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"Safe in thy breast close lock up thy intents,</p>
<p class="i10">For he that knows thy purpose best prevents."&mdash;<i>Randolph.</i></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Isn't that good? Isn't it "<span class="sc">Randolph</span>" to the life? Is anyone
quite certain as to the course our <span class="sc">Randolph</span> will take?</p>

<p>There are, too, quotations from "<span class="sc">R. Chamberlain</span>"&mdash;not from
<span class="sc">Joseph</span>&mdash;with whose works the Baron is not so conversant as he
might be. Saith <span class="sc">R. Chamberlain</span>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"A foolish man in wealth and authority is like a weak-timbered house
with a too-ponderous roof."&mdash;<i>R. Chamberlain.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Baron strongly recommends the study of this volume to Mr.
<span class="sc">Oscar Wilde</span>; it will save him hours of painful cogitation during the
incubation of his next play.</p>

title to suit them. He is to be found at the Heralds' College, and he
is the, <i>par excellence</i>, "Ulster King-at-Arms!"</p>

[The German Emperor is reported to have said, "It was impossible for me to anticipate the rejection of the Army Bills, so fully did I rely upon the
patriotism of the Imperial Diet to accept them unreservedly. A patriotic minority has been unable to prevail against the majority.... I was compelled
to resort to a dissolution, and I look forward to the acceptance of the Bills by the new Reichstag. Should this expectation be again disappointed, I am
determined to use every means in my power to achieve my purpose."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i>]

wandering, in the hope of procuring a place by some
miraculous interposition.</i>

<h3>HOW'S THAT FOR&mdash;HIGH-TEA?</h3>

<h3>DIARY OF A "H. D."</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>At the Service of the Departmental Committee on the Treatment
of Inebriates.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I am afraid that I can no longer resist the temptation
to return to my customary diet. This morning my breakfast was
spoiled by finding that the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> was corked. And this
when I pay 96<i>s.</i> a dozen, and the vintage is 1884! However, it
could not be helped, and I managed to exist until lunch. Then came
another disappointment. I had purposely ordered a light repast, as
I had not much appetite. But I did intend to take it with soda-water&mdash;not
neat. At dinner I managed to get through a biscuit,
and as it was "devilled," it gave me renewed relish for the
morning's champagne. This time the bottles were in excellent condition,
and I quite forgot that earlier in the day one of them had
been corked. All in the half-dozen were in perfect condition&mdash;especially
the last magnum. I do not know how I got to bed.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;When I find that I have not removed my boots overnight,
I know that I require a pick-me-up. A friend joined me at
breakfast, and we both thought the champagne excellent. My friend
<span class="sc">Brown</span>, or perhaps it was <span class="sc">Jones</span>, and now I come to think of it,
it
may have been <span class="sc">Robinson</span>. And yet, when I consider the matter,
there may have been three of them. I tried to count them, and it
took me half the morning. Well, <span class="sc">Brown</span>, or whoever he was, is a
very good fellow. Most amusing, and an excellent audience. He
laughs at everything. Whether you mean it to be funny or not, he
laughs. I like him as a brother. A thoroughly good fellow. We
had a most interesting discussion about the right pronunciation of
Constitution. He said it was in two syllables. I said it was in one.
I think I was right. We had a long chat about it after dinner. First
we talked about it over the port, and then under the table. I don't
know how I managed to get home, but I have a firm belief that it
was all right&mdash;quite all right.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Found my boots again on my feet when recovering
consciousness. So this is the second time I must have slept in them.
I feel excessively melancholy. I have wept very much, and were it
not for the supporting-powers of whiskey, I am sure I should be
much worse. However, there is only one thing to be done&mdash;to keep
at it. One bottle down, another come on. I have floored no end of
a lot of them. Strange to say that I am now happy after all my
sorrow of this morning. Everything is right but the lamp-posts.
They are all wrong. Getting in my way on my road home. I feel
awfully tired. However, seems to be my duty to interfere in a
street-row.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;It appears I had an altercation with the police last
night. I am free, but sorrowful. I really must put myself under
restraint. I feel almost certain that I have given way to intemperance.
On appealing to <span class="sc">Brown</span> (or whoever he is), he says I have
been as drunk as a fly for ages. This hurts me very much. Only
thing to do is to retire into a retreat. Have, with the assistance
of <span class="sc">Brown</span> (or whoever he is), drawn up the application.
It looks right enough. And, as this is my last chance for some time to
come, I and <span class="sc">Brown</span> (or whoever he is) are going to make a night of it.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Boots again! <span class="sc">Brown</span> (or whoever he is) called with
two doctors. I said I couldn't be bothered with them. <span class="sc">Brown</span> (or whoever
he is) said I must. So I saw them. They say that the Act requires
that I must understand what I am doing. All right&mdash;going
into retreat. Word "retreat" should be pronounced as one syllable.
All right, they have made the statutory declaration.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Here I am. Charming place, away from drink, and
ought to do well for the next fortnight. Can't remember how long
I promised to stay, but know it was for some considerable time. I
have just seen the Superintendent. He says he is very sorry, but I
cannot stay any longer. This, in spite of it appearing that I have
signed an application undertaking to remain for life. Can't make it
out. Rather vague about what I have been doing during the week, but
know I wanted to cure myself from habitual inebriety. Superintendent
says he must turn me out under the statute. Appears that I
signed the application for admission when I was not absolutely sober.
Can't be helped. Out I go. Well, there are worse things in the world
than whiskey and port. I have a notion that I am booked for
another night in my boots!</p>

<h3>SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;From a communication to one of the daily
papers, it appears that "a hundred ladies and gentlemen who
find the works of <span class="sc">Hendrik Ibsen</span> (perhaps not all for exactly the
same reasons, but who agree in finding them) among the most interesting
productions of the modern theatre, have guaranteed the estimated
expenses of a series of twelve performances, at which three
of <span class="sc">Ibsen's</span> plays will be presented." This arrangement is carried
out by "each guarantor receiving in seats at the current theatrical
prices the full value of his subscription," as "the State will not subsidize
a theatre, and no millionnaire seems inclined to endow one."</p>

<p>This is clear enough, but it has occurred to me that, as after the
first few performances there may be a goodly number of untenanted
seats, it would be as well to provide auxiliary aid to fill them. It
would scarcely be fair to call upon the guarantors to pay the audience
to be present at the "entertainments" provided for their amusement.
And yet, unless the houses are good, the actors will not do themselves
justice, and the plays of <span class="sc">Hendrik Ibsen</span> will suffer in consequence.
I fear that it would be revolting to humanity to insist upon the
attendance of the less intelligent inmates of the Asylum for Idiots,
and yet here would be an appropriate path out of the difficulty.
Under the circumstances, could not the State (with the aid of a
short Act of Parliament) still render assistance? I see no reason
why thieves and other dishonest characters should not have a
portion of their sentences remitted on condition that they attended
the IBSEN performances. Such an arrangement would save the
rate-payers the expense of the prisoners' keep. The audience I have
suggested would also be free from temptation, for when they were
assisting at a representation of one of <span class="sc">Ibsen's</span> plays, I venture to
believe
they would find nothing worth stealing.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, May 8.</i>&mdash;"What a day we are having, to be
sure!" said <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>, rubbing his hands and smiling delightedly.
Things certainly pretty lively to begin with;
just got into Committee on Home-Rule Bill; <span class="sc">Charlie</span>
(my <span class="sc">Darling</span>) was to have opened Debate with Amendment
on first line of First Clause; but, as he subsequently
explained to sympathetic Committee, he was
weighed down with feeling of diffidence. House, touched
with this unusual weakness on part of Member for Deptford,
readily accepted volunteered service of <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>,
who undertook to say a few words on another
Amendment whilst <span class="sc">Darling</span> was recovering.</p>

<p>No diffidence about <span class="sc">Joseph</span>. As he observed in stormiest
epoch of sitting, he was as cool as a cucumber. "A
cucumber with full allowance of vinegar and pepper,"
<span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> added, in one of those asides with
which he varies the silence of Treasury Bench. Well
there was someone at that temperature. Committee,
take it all together, in volcanic mood. Peculiarity of
situation, as <span class="sc">Saunderson</span> put it, with some mixing of
metaphor, was that "it was the cucumber that kept the
pot a-boiling." Whenever any sign of placidity was
visible, <span class="sc">Joseph</span> sure to appear on scene, rub someone's
hair the wrong way, or stir up some slumbering lion
with long pole.</p>

<p>"Ever stop to watch the Punch show in the streets,
<span class="sc">Toby</span>?" said <span class="sc">Plunket</span>. "No, I suppose not; rather
personal; recall days before you went into politics. Confess
I always do; been chuckling just now over idea that
here we have the whole thing played out. There's <i>Mr.
Punch</i> in person of Mr. G. Up comes a head, <span class="sc">Grandolph's</span>,
or someone else's; down comes the baton in the form of
the Closure. Everyone supposes that Law and Order are
established and things will go smoothly, when suddenly up
springs <span class="sc">Joey</span>, cool as a cucumber, and upsets everything
again. There's nothing new under the sun, not even proceedings
in obstruction of Home-Rule Bill."</p>

<p>After dinner <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span> discovered seated on
Treasury Bench. A great thirst for speech from him suddenly
afflicted Opposition. Mr. G. spoke, and <span class="sc">John Morley</span>
moved the Closure, but nothing would satisfy them save
speech from <span class="sc">Rigby</span>. Pauses in conversation were filled by
cries upon his name. He sat unresponsive, looking wiser
than ever, but still unspeakably wise.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Darling's</span> Amendment got rid of with assistance of
Closure. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> rushed in; hotly moved to report progress.
Only ten o'clock; two hours more before Debate
adjourned. This merrily filled up with divisions, shouting,
and scenes. <span class="sc">Grandolph's</span> motion to Report Progress being
negatived on division. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> moved that Chairman
leave the Chair, division on which just tided Committee over
twelve o'clock, without chance of doing more work.</p>

<p>"I feel twelve years younger," said <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, coming
in from last division. "Reminds me of first Session of 1880
Parliament, when we sat below Gangway there, and bandied
about these alternative resolutuions, me moving to Report Progress;
then, when we came back again, <span class="sc">Wolffy, Gorst</span>, or
sometimes, to give the boy a turn, <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> moved
that Chairman leave the Chair. That was long before he
came into his princedom. House of Commons pretty dull
these six years back. After all, it's the same old place, and,
if we give our mind to it, we can have the same old game."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Got into Committee on Home Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Noisiest evening we have enjoyed since Parliament
elected. Peculiarity of situation was that everybody,
not excluding Chairman of Committees, strenuously anxious
to preserve order. Quiet enough till <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> appeared
on scene, then followed the ordinary cool-cucumbery results.
<span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> torn with anxiety that <span class="sc">Joseph</span> should limit himself
strictly to Motion before Committee. Sort of triangular
duel; <span class="sc">Joseph</span> at corner Bench below Gangway to right of
Chair; <span class="sc">Tim</span> in corresponding position opposite; <span class="sc">Mellor</span> in
(and out of) Chair; all three on their feet simultaneously;
Committee assisting in general desire for peace and order by
tumultuous shouting. <span class="sc">Tim</span> fired furiously at <span class="sc">Joseph</span>;
<span class="sc">Joseph</span> answered shot for shot; Chairman pegged away
alternately at both.</p>

<h4>"Joey up again!" Scene from the Parliamentary Show.</h4></div>

<p>Then <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, finding temptation irresistible, romped
in. "I move," he said, "that the words be taken down."
Very well; quite so; but what words? The Chamber was
full of words, surging like the waters at Lodore. Which
particular ones would <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> like taken down?
Turned out that his desire centred upon almost the only words
that had not been uttered. "I distinctly heard the Member for
Louth say, 'You are knocked up.'" So <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> solemnly
declared, standing at table.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width:300px;"><a href="images/240a.png"><img src="images/240a-100.png" width="100" height="186" alt="Mr. J. G. L-ws-n ..." /></a>
<p><i>Mr. J. G. L-ws-n, having found in a

<p>Whilst Irish Members popped up like
parched peas on Benches below Gangway, <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>
opportunity of looking over his notes, and Chairman, standing at
table, forlornly wrung his hands, <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> sat a model of
Injured Innocence. As it turned
out he, by rare chance, had not
spoken at all. This made clear
upon testimony of <span class="sc">Macartney</span>
and <span class="sc">Johnston</span> of Ballykilbeg.
What <span class="sc">Tim</span> felt most acutely
was, not being thus groundlessly
charged with disorderly
speech, but that <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>,
for whom he has a warm respect,
should imagine that if he <i>had</i>
an observation to offer in the
circumstances, it would be one
so frivolously harmless as that
cited. To observe to somebody
"You are knocked up," might,
with tone of commiseration
thrown in, be a friendly, almost
an affectionate, remark. Why
the words, if uttered at all,
should be taken down, no one
could even guess. <span class="sc">Tim</span> sat in
deep dejection, overborne by
this unexpected and undeserved
contumely. Parched-pea
business on Benches round him
became contagious; <span class="sc">Mellor</span> up
and down in the Chair with
corresponding motion; <span class="sc">Swift
MacNeill</span> shouting something
at top of his voice; Ross rising
to explain; <span class="sc">Johnston</span> of Ballykilbeg
actually
explaining; <span class="sc">Macartney</span>
saying
something; <span class="sc">Tommy
Bowles</span>, not
to be out of it,
moving that somebody
else's words
be taken down. At length, in comparative lull in
storm, Chairman adroitly signalled to <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>,
who continued his speech. Members, generally, gratefully
availed themselves of his interposition to take
their breath.</p>

<p>"Do you know, <span class="sc">Toby</span>, what this reminds me of?"
said Earl <span class="sc">Spencer</span>, looking down on turbulent scene
from Peers' Gallery. "Carries me back to boyhood's
days, and what used to happen when, in temporary
absence of head-master, French usher took charge of
the school."</p>

<p><span class="sc">J. G. Lawson</span>, on spending time in Library, looking
up native name for proposed Legislative Assembly
in Dublin. Found what it used to be called when
<span class="sc">Brian</span> was King; written name down, tries to pronounce
it. <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> says, as far as he can make
out, <span class="sc">Lawson</span> is speaking Welsh; it is suggested that
Chairman shall put Question. <span class="sc">Mellor</span> says he's
quite enough to do to put Amendments in English;
declines to attempt the Irish. <span class="sc">Lawson</span> withdraws,
using awful language, which he insists is Irish. It
sounds even worse.</p>

<p><i>Saturday Morning.</i>&mdash;Another afternoon in Committee on Home-Rule
Bill. Not so lively as yesterday, but equal amount of business
not done, which, after all is the thing. House fairly full; gunpowder
lying about in all directions, as shown by occasional flash; and one
regular explosion. Went off to Library; sat in quiet corner with
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span> last book in hand. Fancy I must have fallen
asleep; found tall figure sitting next to me; drowsily recognised
<span class="sc">Raikes</span>. Couldn't be <span class="sc">Raikes</span>, you know; long ago gone to another
place. Yet figure unmistakeable, and voice well remembered. Seem
to have been asking him question.</p>

<p>"What do I think about new Chairman?" he was saying.
"Well, of course, that is a delicate question to put to me; was
Chairman myself for many sessions; know every thorn in the
cushion of the seat. It is, I should say, the most difficult post in
House; far more so than <span class="sc">Speaker's</span>. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> is robed about with
authority that does not pertain to Chairman. Observations which,
addressed to <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, would be flat blasphemy, are, when flung at
Chairman of Ways and Means, merely choleric words. Apart from
that, position is, through long stretches of sitting, more arduous.
When full-dress debate going on, <span class="sc">Speaker</span> of judgment and experience
can go easy; may even, upon occasion, strategically doze.
One did in times not so long ago, and was caught <i>flagrante asleepoh</i>.
<span class="sc">Mackworth Praed</span> was Member of the House then; made little
speech in verse on incident. You remember it?</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Sleep, Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>; it's surely fair,</p>
<p>If you don't in your bed, that you should in your Chair;</p>
<p>Longer and longer still they grow,</p>
<p>Tory and Radical, Aye and No</p>
<p>Talking by night, and talking by day.</p>
<p>Sleep, Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>; sleep, sleep, while you may.</p>

<h4>Blind Man's Buff with the Chairman; or, "The Mellor and His Men."</h4></div>

<p>"Chairman must be on alert every moment in Committee. Rule
under his jurisdiction is conversation as opposed to speech-making
when <span class="sc">Speaker</span> in Chair. Any moment out of depths of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'dulness' is an alternative spelling for 'dullness'. (Oxford Online Dictionary).">dulness</ins> may
suddenly rise a whirlwind, which he is expected forthwith to ride.
Especially in connection with Bill like this now before Committee,
Chairman is in state of tension from time he takes Chair till he
leaves. Don't forget all this when you criticise <span class="sc">Mellor</span>, still new
to place. He's a good fellow, and a shrewd one; but has, among
other difficulties, to fight against proneness to good-nature. Good-nature
out of place in the Chair. <span class="sc">Courtney</span> knew that, and successfully
overcame his natural tendencies. <span class="sc">Mellor</span> too anxious to
oblige. Must get over that. Above all, should never explain.
Suddenly called upon for decision on knotty point, must needs make
mistake sometimes. If he does, unless it be very serious, <i>he should
stick to it</i>. For Chairman of Committees, better to be in the wrong
and uphold authority of Chair, than to wriggle into the right at its
expense. <span class="sc">Mellor</span> should be more monosyllabic in his style, more
ruthless in his dealing with disorderly interruption, more wary
about putting his foot down, but, being planted, it should be immovable.
It would make his fortune if he could only name
<span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>. That would be difficult, I know, for <span class="sc">Joey C.</span> is
sly,
dev'lish sly. He should begin with <span class="sc">Jemmy Lowther</span>, who gives
plenty of chances. Thence he might work upwards. Is that a bell
ringing? Yes. Must be off, or I'll get shut out. We've lately
adopted the Early Closing Movement."</p>

<p>Certainly bell was ringing; it was for Division on Clause I. Still
fact seems to run on all fours with what I remember <span class="sc">Raikes</span> talking
of just now. Yet, again, when one comes to think of it, can a bell
run on all fours? Everything very strange. Shall go and vote.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Clause I. agreed to.</p>
